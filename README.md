# WordBase-Solver-remake-
My complete rework of my original WordBase Solver, this time with image OCR.


WordBase is a game on the app store where 
users fight for territorial supremacy by
spelling out words on a game board.

http://www.wordbaseapp.com/

This is the second version of a solver
for the game that I rebuilt form the
ground up.

Features:

    OCR - input a screenshot and it'll read the board for you
    Solving - generates all possible words that can be made
    Sorting - ranks the words based off their usefulness
    
Usage:

    Put an screenshot image file in the same folder as the classes.
    Compile and run WordBasePlayer.java.
    Either input the name of your image file OR "saved.txt" to access your most recent screenshot.
    You can manually edit saved.txt for a quick change.
